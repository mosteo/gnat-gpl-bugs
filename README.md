# GNAT GPL 2017 bugs

Test cases for various bugs in the latest GNAT GPL edition, to check their fixing on successive editions.

Files in `src` folder are stand-alone open bug reproducers.

Files in `src/fixed` are reproducers for bugs already fixed in the current GPL edition.

## Status ##

All bugs I reported in 2016 are fixed in the 2017 adition.
No new bugs known yet.
